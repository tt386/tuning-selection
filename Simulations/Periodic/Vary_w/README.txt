# RunFiles 
wFunfile iterates over wlist, calling Runfile sequentially for each w value

Runfile calls the Script.py for each K value, in parallel.


# Plotting
MultiPlotting.py calls Plotting.py sequentially, taking the main output of the global minima and bounds for plotting.

Plotting.py created the minima curve for each w value.
